# Hello World Python :wave: 

### Why The Heck should I learn another language? :neutral_face: 
> **python is the best 2nd language to learn**

**If you're a Web or Native Developer, you probably know a lang or two but what if you want to develop your own tool belt? like a test library and you dont want to put a lot of time and energy on another lang.**
**python is the answer!**

### Python Usage?
> **if you're learning Machine Learning, Python is Necessary**

**when it comes to penetration testing and exploitation tools, python is #1**

here are some python use cases:

### Python is a very simple language...:smiley:
**and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).**

### There are two major Python versions...:thinking:
**Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are quite different. [This tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org) uses Python 3, because it more semantically correct and supports newer features.**

### one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print statement.
**In Python 2, the "print" statement is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without parentheses.**
```py
print 'Hello'
```
**However, in Python 3, it is a function, and must be invoked with parentheses.**
```py
print('Hello')
```
